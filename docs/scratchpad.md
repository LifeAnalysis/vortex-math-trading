# Vortex Math Trading System - Scratchpad

## Current Active Task
- **Task:** Vortex Math Trading Backtesting System
- **Implementation Plan:** `docs/implementation-plan/vortex-math-trading-system.md`
- **Status:** Execution Phase - Task 1.1

## Project Overview
Creating a comprehensive vortex math trading backtesting system with advanced mathematical rigor:
- **Modular Arithmetic Foundation**: Digital root ≡ n mod 9 with proper mathematical implementation
- **Multiple Sequence Types**: Standard doubling (×2), tripling (×3), and custom multipliers
- **Base Variations**: Compare base-8, base-10 patterns for robustness testing
- **Tesla's 3-6-9 Analysis**: Oscillation patterns and "balance" point detection
- **Statistical Validation**: Performance against random strategies, overfitting prevention
- **Hybrid Strategies**: Integration with Fibonacci and technical indicators
- **Critical Analysis**: Include mathematical critiques and limitations

## Lessons Learned
- [2024-01-XX] Always ensure JavaScript event listeners match HTML element IDs exactly (kebab-case vs camelCase mismatch caused broken functionality)
- [2024-01-XX] When simplifying UI, maintain script inclusion consistency (missing tradingview-app.js script caused functionality gaps)
- [2024-01-XX] User-driven HTML improvements require corresponding JavaScript updates to maintain functionality
- [2024-01-XX] CDN dependencies are more reliable than local script files for external libraries like TradingView
- [2025-01-17] TradingView Lightweight Charts v5 API changed: use `chart.addSeries(LineSeries, options)` instead of deprecated `chart.addLineSeries(options)` - always check API documentation when encountering "function is not a function" errors with external libraries
- [2025-01-17] **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Tesla Filter completely overrides manual Buy/Hold/Sell signals in vortex strategy. When Tesla 3-6-9 filter is enabled, it dominates signal generation regardless of user-configured digital root settings. Manual signals (e.g., Buy=2, Hold=9, Sell=4) only function when Tesla filter is disabled. This explains why identical results occurred with different configurations when Tesla filter was active.
- [2025-01-17] Strategy optimization requires systematic testing of filter combinations: Tesla filter generates high-frequency trading (74 trades, 2551% return) while manual signals can create ultra-conservative strategies (1 trade, 868% return with 96% drawdown). Understanding filter hierarchy is crucial for strategy performance analysis.

## Notes
- Focus on mathematical rigor while acknowledging vortex math limitations
- Implement multiple approaches for comparison (base variations, multipliers)
- Statistical validation is crucial - compare against random entry strategies
- Start with UI first, then API integration
- Use small vertical slices with comprehensive testing at each step
