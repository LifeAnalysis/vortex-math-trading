# Vortex Math Trading System - Scratchpad

## Current Active Task
- **Task:** Vortex Math Trading Backtesting System
- **Implementation Plan:** `docs/implementation-plan/vortex-math-trading-system.md`
- **Status:** Execution Phase - Task 1.1

## Project Overview
Creating a trading backtesting system based on vortex math principles, specifically:
- Digital root calculations for price analysis
- Doubling sequence pattern recognition (1-2-4-8-7-5)
- Tesla's 3-6-9 significance analysis
- Backtesting framework with BTC historical data from CoinGecko API

## Lessons Learned
*No lessons learned yet - project just started*

## Notes
- Focus on simplicity and clear implementation
- Start with UI first, then API integration
- Use small vertical slices with testing at each step
