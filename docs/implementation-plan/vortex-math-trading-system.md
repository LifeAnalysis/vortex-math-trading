# Vortex Math Trading System Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The goal is to create a comprehensive vortex math trading backtesting system that applies Marko Rodin's vortex mathematics principles to cryptocurrency trading analysis. This system will:

1. **Core Vortex Math Implementation**: Digital root calculations, doubling sequence analysis (1-2-4-8-7-5), and Tesla's 3-6-9 pattern recognition
2. **Data Integration**: Fetch historical cryptocurrency data (starting with BTC) from CoinGecko API
3. **Trading Strategy**: Implement buy/sell signals based on digital root patterns (buy on digital root 1, sell on digital root 5)
4. **Backtesting Framework**: Complete backtesting engine with performance metrics and visualization
5. **User Interface**: Clean, modern web interface for strategy configuration and results visualization

The system aims to bridge the metaphysical concepts of vortex math with practical trading application, providing a research tool for exploring numerical patterns in market data.
