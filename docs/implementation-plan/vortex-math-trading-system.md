# Vortex Math Trading System Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The goal is to create a comprehensive vortex math trading backtesting system that applies Marko Rodin's vortex mathematics principles to cryptocurrency trading analysis. This system will:

1. **Core Vortex Math Implementation**: Digital root calculations, doubling sequence analysis (1-2-4-8-7-5), and Tesla's 3-6-9 pattern recognition
2. **Multi-Cryptocurrency Data Integration**: Fetch historical cryptocurrency data (Bitcoin, Solana) from CoinGecko MCP API
3. **Trading Strategy**: Implement buy/sell signals based on digital root patterns (buy on digital root 1, sell on digital root 5)
4. **Backtesting Framework**: Complete backtesting engine with performance metrics and visualization
5. **User Interface**: Clean, modern web interface with cryptocurrency selector and strategy configuration

**NEW REQUIREMENT (Current Focus)**: 
- Fetch Solana daily close data from March 2021 to August 10, 2025 using CoinGecko MCP
- Add cryptocurrency dropdown selector (Bitcoin/Solana)
- Ensure both datasets work with existing backtesting and chart rendering systems

The system aims to bridge the metaphysical concepts of vortex math with practical trading application, providing a research tool for exploring numerical patterns in market data across multiple cryptocurrencies.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Multi-Cryptocurrency Support Request (NEW) ðŸ”„
**Date**: Current  
**Task**: Add Solana support with cryptocurrency selector  
**Status**: PLANNED

**User Request**: "Now I want you to fetch all of the daily closed data for Solana from March of 2021 until 10th of August 2025 and then save it in a JSON format like the way you did with the Bitcoin daily closed prices. Then I want you to create a drop-down menu where I can either select Bitcoin or Solana to then run the backtesting. If I select Solana, you will need to pass all of the data to both the backtesting model and the chart renderer. Use CoinGecko's MCP to fetch and store the data."

2. **Data Storage**: Save in JSON format matching existing Bitcoin data structure (`sol-historical-data.json`)  
3. **UI Enhancement**: Add cryptocurrency selector dropdown to configuration section
4. **System Integration**: Update data loading, backtesting, and chart rendering to support both cryptocurrencies
5. **Validation**: Ensure vortex math calculations and performance metrics work correctly for both datasets

**Key Requirements**:
- Use CoinGecko MCP specifically (not regular API)
- Match existing Bitcoin data JSON format exactly
- Seamless UI switching between cryptocurrencies
